It's my implementation of project from Hyperskill(https://hyperskill.org/projects/91?track=12). 

On the vast expanse of the internet, you'll frequently come across a variety of websites that invite you to engage in answering questions. These range from educational platforms, psychological assessment tests, job hunting services, to simply fun-filled web quests for entertainment. What unites these diverse sites is their interactive feature of posing quizzes or questions to users, followed by revealing intriguing results or outcomes.
